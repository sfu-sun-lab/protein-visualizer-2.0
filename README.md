Protein Visualizer 2.0:
URL: https://mdesai31.github.io/Protein-Visualizer-2.0/

This web application visualizes protein glycosylation sites, disulfide bonds, sequon sites, and cysteine sites (obtained from UniProt) to illustrate patterns in their arrangement in relation to the protein topology.

- Search for a human protein to visualize from the Uniprot database or select one of several example proteins to visualize from the drop down menu located above this card.

- If the current scale of the visualization is not sufficient to identify patterns, a sliding scale is provided on the top right of the app bar to horizontally expand the protein.

- In addition to the sliding scale, there is a window feature for each protein that allows users to target a specific region for visualization. This feature is located below the original visualization.

- The legend moves with the page as the user scrolls, keeping the information always within reach. Additionally, the legend and each protein feature can be toggled to enhance viewability.

- An export image feature is provided, allowing users to capture publication-quality snapshots of the protein and the window.

Please cite the following publication(s) when using the visualizer:
